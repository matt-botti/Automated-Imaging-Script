To use this, just right click on "Automated Fresh Image Setup.exe" and run as Administrator. 
After you are prompted on which programs you want installed, you should not need to touch anything until this script is done running (except the printer prompt, but I'd like to fix that eventually).
I can't recommend modifying any of the files in here.
